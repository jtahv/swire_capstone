
Run the block and you'll have:
- customer_totals_simple: customer yearly volumes, separated by the year (2 rows per customer)
- customer_totals_yearly: customer yearly volumnes with more columns, separated by the year (2 rows by customer)
- customer_totals_wide: 1 row per customer. Should be best for modeling 

Each dataframe has a target variable red_truck_flag 1/0 (1 if 400 gallons or more for the year, 0 if less than 400 gals)
